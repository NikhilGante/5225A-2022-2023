/* Nathan's Thoughts
change most #defines to constexpr
replace C macros with C++ equivalents (M_PI) - not super important
std::string instead of const char*
const after type (int const, char const *)
acivate using namespace pros in main.h
try to remove using namespace std if everyone is ok with that
switch variadic functions to variadic templates
make more methods const
